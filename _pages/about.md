I am a PhD student of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, advised by Prof. [Ahmed Sabbir Arif](http://www.asarif.com/), at the [University of California, Merced](https://www.ucmerced.edu/).


My research interest lies in the general area of alternative devices in HCI , particularly on interaction and input methods on wearable devices and flexible display.

I received my Master Degree in [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), and Bachelorâ€™s Degree in [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://en.njtu.edu.cn/).
